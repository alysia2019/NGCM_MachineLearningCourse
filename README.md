  # NGCM Machine Learning Course
Notes, demos and materials for learning Machine Learning

## Extra materials

In addition to the material in this git repository, we've also used materials from our computer vision, data mining and deep learning modules. Please feel free to take a look at the lecture slides and notes for these which can be found here:
