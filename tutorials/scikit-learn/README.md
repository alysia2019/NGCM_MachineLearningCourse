# NGCM Machine Learning Course: Using sklearn

Welcome to the repository for our workshop, part of the festival for doctoral research 2019. The notebooks are grouped into folders according to the skills / tools that they cover. Specifcally these are: Python, scikit-learn and Keras. While it is possible to run the notebooks on your own machine, we recommend opening them in a Colab environment.

## Opening in Colab

Colab is a free resource provided by Google that can be used to run Jupyter notebooks. It provides a useful platform to develop and test data science code, even if it requires the use of a GPU. The notebooks in this repo can be opened in Colab by clicking the buttons below:

- *Easy:* Diabetes prediction - Decision tree classification: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jonhare/NGCM_MachineLearningCourse/blob/master/tutorials/scikit-learn/Decision_Trees.ipynb)
- *Intermediate:* Text classification - K-means, KNN, SVM: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jonhare/NGCM_MachineLearningCourse/blob/master/tutorials/scikit-learn/KMeans_KNN_SVM.ipynb)

Note, once loaded, we recommend you select the `copy to drive` button in the top left corner, this will let you save your work in your google drive.
