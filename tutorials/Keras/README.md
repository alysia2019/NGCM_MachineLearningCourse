# NGCM Machine Learning Course: Using Keras 

This tutorial exposes you to Keras for Deep Learning. There are a three notebooks to work through. While it is possible to run the notebooks on your own machine, we recommend opening them in a Colab environment.

## Opening in Colab

Colab is a free resource provided by Google that can be used to run Jupyter notebooks. It provides a useful platform to develop and test data science code, even if it requires the use of a GPU. The notebooks in this repo can be opened in Colab by clicking the links below:
